= Foreword

`julia` is a language which I have a love-hate relationship with. If the first programming language you learned is `python`, I think `julia` offers a fresh take on what you can do with computers while having the interactiveness of `python`. It has a lot of modern features built into the language, such as its just-in-time (JIT) compilation, multiple dispatch, and metaprogramming capabilities. It also comes with its own package manager, which is quite nice to use. This makes `julia` a great "advance" language for data scientists to learn after `python`. However, the `julia` ecosystem is not nearly as mature as `python`, as a lot of its packages are maintained by small communities, and some time they lead to down some dead ends.

Nonetheless, `julia` is a fun language to play with.
