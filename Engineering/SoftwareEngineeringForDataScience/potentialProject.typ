Since this is a one-semester project, it will be helpful to keep the scope of the project relatively small. 

There are a couple of milestones I would like you to hit during this course, which are
1. Implmenting the core logic of your project.
2. Design an interface to serve your project.
3. Release the code and the service to the world.

== Step 1: Go wild

The first step of 

== Step 2: Come back to reality

After you have finished brainstorming a list of potential projects, here is a list of questions to help you filter for the most suitable projects:
1. *Define one major objective for your project.* Be as concise as possible.
2. *Is this goal acheivable in 13 weeks timescale, with 1 day a week commitment mainly from you?*
3. *Where are you sourcing the data?* Downloading public dataset? Generating the data yourself? Make sure there is not privacy issue or license issue when you are using public dataset.
4. *What is main computation?* It is not required in this course you build a complicated model, I am not even going to require you to use any machine learning in your model. Make sure you have access to enough compute at every stage of the project, from collecting data to deployment.
5. *What are the features you want your product to have?* Is it to serve a dataset with some interactibility? Does it have to be very accurate?
6. *Are you excited about the project?* Choosing something you are excited about is almost always beneficial.

When you are choosing your potential projects, keep these three milestone in mind. I think your enjoyment of the class will be maximized if you choose your project according to 

== Examples

Here is a list of potential projects to give you some ideas what is in the scope of this course, but I always encourage and prefer people work on something they are truly passion about:

For example, using computing vision algorithm to track the take-off velocity of myself in my high jump tapes is a good example. Solving world hunger
